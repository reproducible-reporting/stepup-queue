StepUp Queue is an experimental [StepUp](https://reproducible-reporting.github.io/stepup-core)
extension to integrate queued jobs into a workflow.
Currently, it only supports integration with [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/),
but it is designed to be extensible to other job schedulers.

For more information, consult the [documentation](https://reproducible-reporting.github.io/stepup-queue).
